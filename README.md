# Bikesharing Project - Analysis of NYC Citi Bike in August 2019

# Project Overview

This Project was inspired when we were using citi bikes to travel around in New York City, and NYC has this bikesharing program across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and New Jersey City, it is really a convenience way for travellers. After visiting NYC, we have an idea which is it possible to copy the bikesharing business operation in our home town Des Moines. Thus we need to analyze the data provided by citi bike.

By doing that, the first step we need is to change the data type of tripduration column by using jupyter notebook, and then connect the updated data into Tableau to do the analysis.

# Results

First we count the total number of rides in August 2019, which is 2,344,224 rides. This is a large number of use for bikesharing program,that means the program is popular among the cities.

Then we plot the gender breakdown to see which gender use bike more frequently. From the pie chart, it is easily to see male are willing to use the bike than females.

From the following bar chart, it is shown that the peak hours of using bikes in August are 7-8am and 17-18pm, which are the interval of commute time, so the bikesharing program is popular among the commute people.

Another evidence is the heat map we ploted, from the following heat map, it was darker on 7-8am and 17-18pm from Monday to Friday.

On weekend, the trips are usually take on between 10am-17pm, which means the use of bikes are most likely take by vistors in weekend.

Further more, we breakdown the trips for gender on everyday use. Clearly we can tell male users are more likely to ride bike if the distance allowed.

Lastly, we polt the line chart for checkout time for user and gender. From the following charts, we conclude the checkout time is usually under 60 minites, and males checkout out time is almost triple the females, which is prove our views males are willing to ride bike than females.

# Summary

A ride-sharing program like Citi Bike is a great offering for a community. With 2,344,224 bike rides in August there is much data to analyze. Most Citi Bike trips are short, less than one hour. The Citi Bike data shows that bike sharing is used for commuters and those looking for some weekend fun. Subscribers are the main business model. When looking at subscriber rate and duration of use, men tend to use the program more. Having a bike repair plan is a must especially for the bikes used in the most popular areas.

A few additional visualizations to perform with the given data set are an analysis of times of bike usage and age range. It would also help to look at how far do bikers travel and which stations are most popular. A closer examination of the station locations might provide clarity on why more women aren't using the bike-share program.
