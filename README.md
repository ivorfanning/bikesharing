# Bikesharing Project - Analysis of NYC Citi Bike in August 2019

# Project Overview

This Project was inspired when we were using citi bikes to travel around in New York City, and NYC has this bikesharing program across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and New Jersey City, it is really a convenience way for travellers. After visiting NYC, we have an idea which is it possible to copy the bikesharing business operation in our home town Des Moines. Thus we need to analyze the data provided by citi bike.

By doing that, the first step we need is to change the data type of tripduration column by using jupyter notebook, and then connect the updated data into Tableau to do the analysis.

# Results

First we count the total number of rides in August 2019, which is 2,344,224 rides. This is a large number of use for bikesharing program,that means the program is popular among the cities.

Then we plot the gender breakdown to see which gender use bike more frequently. From the pie chart, it is easily to see male are willing to use the bike than females.
